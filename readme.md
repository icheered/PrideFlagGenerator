# Pride flag generator

This tool was made to create vertical 1x255 pride flag images for my light painting stick (magilight) for light photography at a pride event.

The config file follows the following format:

```
name,portionOfTotal,color
```

The 'portionOfTotal' argument is used for flags that have wider bands of some colors than other colors like the bisexual flag:

```
bisexual,2,#D60270
bisexual,1,#9B4F96
bisexual,2,#0038A8
```
